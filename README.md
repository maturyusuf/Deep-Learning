## Introduction

Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on using artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems. This repository aims to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of deep learning and guide you through building various neural network architectures.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorials, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of:

- Python programming language
- NumPy and Pandas libraries for data manipulation
- Knowledge of Machine Learning concepts (e.g., supervised and unsupervised learning)

## Tutorials

The tutorials in this repository are organized as follows:

1. **Introduction to Neural Networks**: Get started with the basics of neural networks and learn how to build a simple feedforward neural network.
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Explore CNNs, a powerful architecture for image recognition tasks.
3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Learn about RNNs and their applications in sequential data processing.
4. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: Understand LSTM, a special type of RNN, useful for capturing long-term dependencies.
5. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)**: Dive into GANs, a framework for generating realistic synthetic data.
6. **Transfer Learning**: Learn how to leverage pre-trained models for your specific tasks.
7. **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Explore reinforcement learning with neural networks for decision-making tasks.
8. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Apply deep learning techniques to process and analyze text data.

Each tutorial comes with detailed code examples and datasets to help you implement the concepts effectively.
